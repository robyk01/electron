# Electron - Circuit Simulator

A Python-based circuit simulator built with Pygame that allows users to design and simulate DC electrical circuits through an interactive graphical interface.

## Features

- **Interactive Circuit Design**: Place and drag components on a grid-based workspace
- **Component Library**: Resistors, voltage sources, capacitors, and transistors
- **DC Circuit Solver**: Nodal Analysis implementation using NumPy for accurate circuit simulation
- **Real-time Calculations**: Compute node voltages and component currents
